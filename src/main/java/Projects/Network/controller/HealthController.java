/**
 * HealthController
 *
 * This controller is responsible for exposing a simple health-check endpoint.
 * It allows external systems (load balancers, monitoring tools, DevOps
 * pipelines)
 * or developers to verify that the application is running correctly.
 *
 * This controller belongs to the Controller layer of the application and does
 * not
 * contain any business logic. Its sole responsibility is to handle HTTP
 * requests
 * and return an appropriate response.
 *
 * The controller uses Spring WebFlux and returns reactive types in order to
 * support non-blocking and asynchronous communication.

     *
     * This method exposes a GET HTTP endpoint at "/health".
     * It is typically used to check whether the application is up and running.

     * The method returns a Mono containing a Map with basic status information:
     * - "status": indicates the global state of the application
     * - "message": provides a human-readable description
     *
     * The use of Mono ensures that the response is handled in a non-blocking
     * reactive manner, which is consistent with Spring WebFlux principles.
